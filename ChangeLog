2009-03-29: Version 0.2
 * General:
   * Change: Use pickle protocol 0 (ASCII) for storing the cached revision
   * Fix: Don't print to stdout to prevent problems with mod_wsgi
   * Fix: "trac-admin upgrade" wouldn't mark the Trac environment as upgraded.
   * Fix: Don't just assume Python is installed in /usr/bin/, install use /usr/bin/env for locating python
   * Fix: Allow scanning of Unicode files by scanning them as Unicode if the 'enable_unicode' option is true (set to true by default)
   * Fix: Don't interpret empty configuration lists as a list with one empty string. This prevents disabling of scanning the repository as a result of a default option for exclude_folders
 * Renderer:
   * Change: Use Genshi instead of ClearSilver on Trac 0.11+

2008-11-26: Version 0.1
 * General:
   * Change: Only match whole words: thus match the word's boundaries as well
   * Fix: Didn't handle deleted files and files that lost all tags properly
   (regex '\b')
   * Change: Add a new option 'exclude_folders' to exclude paths from being searched
   * Change: Add some package info to the egg's data
   * Change: Make sure that the initial generation of codetags cache happens in "trac-admin upgrade" (prevents the need for doing this through the webserver, which usually has timeouts in place)
   * Optimisation: skip all subdirectories and files of excluded folders
   * Optimisation: skip directories that don't need to be scanned or aren't parents of those that need to be
   * Fix: don't perform any HTML rendering when upgrading the environment
